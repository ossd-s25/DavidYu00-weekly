### OSI Presentation
The OSI presentation on AI made much more clear why their organization is necessary beyond having a definition for open source AI. Before the presentation, I was a little confused on how such an organization can work with companies that produce LLMs. I figured that the companies would not be open to participating because it would put limits on how their business operate. However, the presentation made it more clear that the organization is fighting against the companies externally, and has more sway publically and politically to help them fight against how the open source definition is being warped by LLM companies. 
The presentation also mentioned open source washing, which I thought was interesting. AI model companies are bastardizing the definition of open source to market themselves, all the while keeping parts of their source code hidden. They may also claim that they are only partially open source, but to OSI that is not a legitimate position.
