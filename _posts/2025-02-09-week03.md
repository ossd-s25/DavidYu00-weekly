title: Week 3 Browser Extensions

### Making a chrome extension
This week we worked in groups to make our first chrome extension. Our group ended up making a currency and unit converter. 

One difficulty that I encountered was finding an idea to implement. Since it was the first time we were making an extension, and since we were worried about time constraints, we wanted to keep the extension simple. It took a while to settle on an idea, and that was after browsing popular existing extensions. If the project was to make something more original then I would have struggled to think of a good idea. While learning to make the extension was good practice, developing something not already available would be much more difficult.

I like that working together with a team makes it easier for ideas to be built upon, as an initial suggestion will be passed around and added to. But collaborating also comes with some difficulties. I have not used JS for a pretty long time, so I think it was difficult to contribute to code on the spot outside of verbal suggestions. The group hasn't really faced any notable problems, and most of the work was finished during the class period. Still, I think I was pretty good at communicating and getting everyone on the same page about what we were doing.
